## ClassVisa Training ToDo Web App

This is a simple todo app created in a team during the ClassVisa training, while learning about "How Github commands work within team".  Thanks to our trainer Abi and all the team member for making this a reality :D

## How the tasks was divided:
1. Stephen will build "Add" Functionality
2. Oreo will build "List" Functionality
3. Samuel will build "delete" Functionality 
4. Rasheed will build "quit" Functionality

## We have used:
+ **HTML5** for markup
+ Pure **CSS3** for styling \
+ Bit of **JavaScript** to make a hamburger menu to work on mobile devices 
+ **Google Fonts** for font styles 

You can add more things to make it even cooler! The comments in the code will help you navigate through it. Have a nice day! :D
